Draft Order App

This app allows a user to add players to a fantasy sports league, then draft those players in a random order.

The app is currently completely funcitonal as intended, although I may revisit this project later to add better styling.

NOTE: There's currently a bug in the randomized order, in which the first player entered will always be the last returned. I'm not actively working on resolving this issue, but will fix it if I come back to this project.
